Starting Mar 9, 2019 Google bans apps with CallLog and SendSMS permissions. The claim these to be dangerous permissions and only allow certain types of apps to get an exlussion to obtain these permissions. The CallLog permissions is what's needed to identify incoming calls. While the SendSMS permission is required to be able to send SMS, or auto-respond.

We have tried to obtain an exceptions for Silence, claiming it to be a legitimate use case for these permissions. Yet each time Google has responded with a denial, without clarifying the reason. In light of this, any update, whether bug fix or a feature update, must comply with this new policy.
